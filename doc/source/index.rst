Untargeted specs
================

.. note::

   The following specs have been approved but have not been completed
   in the originally planned release.  Rather than remove them, they
   have been made 'untargeted' for future reference.  If you would like
   to work on one of these specs, please re-propose it for the appropriate
   release.  The review will most likely be quick, but we need to make sure
   that everyone still understands the spec as written, and that it still
   fits in with the Cinder project's plans.
