rbd: Add snapshot mirroring support
===================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/rbd-snapshot-mirroring

This would be a good small project for someone interested in learning
about rbd and setting up an rbd test environment.  The blueprint was
proposed back in 2021 and has code proposed, but the original author
decided not to pursue it.  You can make yourself a co-author and complete
the patch.

This was a small change, so it doesn't have a full spec, just a blueprint
in Launchpad outlining the change.
