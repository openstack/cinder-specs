================================================================
Support Linux on System z (S/390) as a hypervisor platform
================================================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/linux-systemz

There are some platform-specific changes needed in order to allow Cinder
manage FCP-based block storage on Linux on System z.

Additional OpenStack functionality beyond initial Cinder support is not part of
this blueprint; we will have specific additional blueprints for that, as
needed.

Required support in Nova is described by a separate blueprint which is listed
as a dependency below.

iSCSI does not require any changes.


Problem description
===================

Linux on System z differs from other Linux platforms in the following
respects:

* System z uses a different format for device file paths (ccw-based, rather
  than pci-based)

* Auto-discovery for fibre-channel devices can be configured online, or
  offline. In case auto-discovery is turned off, devices need to be
  added, and removed explicitly by OpenStack (unit_add, unit_remove)

* vHBAs may be turned online, or offline. Offline vHBAs need to be
  ignored.

Use Cases
=========

Proposed change
===============

Change code in Cinder to address these issues, dependent on the host
capabilities indicating a CPU architecture of ``arch.S390X``, and
``arch.S390``.
For details, see section `Work Items`_.

In ``cinder/brick/initiator/connector.py``:

* connect_volume needs to support the System z specific format of the
  device file paths and issue the unit_add command (which is done
  by calling the new configure_scsi_device() function)

  ::

Dependencies
============

Nova blueprint to add support for KVM/libvirt in Linux on System z
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-kvm-systemz


Testing
=======

Unit test:

* Unit tests will be added and performed on System z, as well as
  Intel-based machines.
* We will provide an environment for CI testing on System z.
  This is described by the Nova blueprint which is listed as a dependency.
  We will test Cinder and Nova on System z in this environment.


Documentation Impact
====================

* No changes needed in config docs.

* Doc changes for the platform will be made as needed (details are to be
  determined).
